      Ooigo is the first audio app specifically designed for children and teenagers. It was developed by the renowned audio book label EUROPA. As a regular partner we are responsible for all design topics related to the app, website, social media, online and classic marketing. In addition, we have been consistently supporting Sony Music in the ongoing development of the product since 2018.

      The audio book app Ooigo filters streaming content by age and interests. As it is used by children, the focus has been on making it as easy and intuitive to use as possible. The appâ€™s UI design therefore relies on clear colours, a look appropriate for children and as few operating elements as necessary. Illustration and design details have been worked out tastefully, so that the app is fun to use and the young target group will want to listen to it regularly.

      For a consistent appearance in all applications, we documented all design elements in a pattern library. Based on this foundation, we adapted the basic design for the app, website, videos, social media, print media and merchandise.
