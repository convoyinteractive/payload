      Since its foundation in Hamburg in 1976, Golf House has become the largest golf retailer in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic.

      In addition to 29 retail stores, the company operates its own e-commerce website. During its recent relaunch we were responsible for creative direction and design.

    title: Key factors for a successful user experience
    body: |
      For a successful user experience in e-commerce, consistency in design, excellent usability and the consideration of user behaviour are crucial. It is therefore essential to develop the user interface systematically and to organize design components in libraries in a clear and comprehensible manner. Living style guides and pattern libraries help with the consistent development of the design and thus support the sustainable management of the website.
