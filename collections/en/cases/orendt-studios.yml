    title: Picture Perfect
    body: |
      Since the majority of the clients of Orendt Studios come from the fashion industry, we focused on a puristic layout and strong black and white contrasts for the relaunch of the website. This created an ideal stage for the colorful, visually appealing content, which we presented in large format.

    title: Content in context
    body: |
      The core of the new website are the elaborately arranged case studies. A virtual room was designed for each project and adapted to the branding of the respective client. So, the content produced by Orendt Studios appears directly in the right context. In addition, the modular structure facilitates content maintenance and the creation of further cases.
