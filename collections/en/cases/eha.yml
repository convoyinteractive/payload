      For more than five years we have been supporting the Hamburg-based energy service provider EHA as its regular design partner. Within the scope of a design refresh in mid-2019, we comprehensively revised the EHA branding. We then adapted the newly created guidelines to the website, software and a variety of marketing materials and have been consistently developing these further ever since.

      When we revised the branding, we focused particularly on the digital touchpoints through which customers interact with EHA. For the first time, the main focus of the redesign was not on business stationery and printed communication, but instead on website, software and online marketing.

      For internal EHA use, we created a pattern library that allows employees to access guidelines and assets at any time. Since all elements of the website’s frontend feed directly from the library, any changes made there automatically appear on the website.

      As part of the redesign of various EHA software components to visualise planning and consumption data, we developed specific sets of icon sets and extended the existing colour scheme. In doing so, we were able to cater to the respective software requirements and at the same time make sure that its user interfaces integrated optimally into the new branding.
