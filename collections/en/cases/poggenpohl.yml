    title: From review to outlook
    body: |
      The most important milestones of the Poggenpohl company history are what open the doors to the microsite. On the homepage you scroll through these in chronological order until reaching the present day (bottom of the page). There, you’re presented with two new kitchen series. A click on one of the two teasers takes you deeper into the page and directly to the selected product.

    title: Emotional product experience
    body: |
      We tell the story on two layers: products are presented in color and large format, supplemented by black and white snapshots that emotionally charge the product communication. This impression is reinforced by the fonts used: on the one hand a factual, informative grotesque, on the other a light-looking italic.

      By combining these elements, a visually exciting page layout emerges that guides visitors through the story. The adaptable layout grid is reinterpreted on every subpage, thus ensuring variety.

    body: |
      On the occasion of the 125th anniversary, we staged a visually stunning film loop for the Poggenpohl in-house exhibition parallel to the microsite. To this end, we took up the mechanics of the two narrative levels again and transferred them to a video wall consisting of nine large-format screens.
