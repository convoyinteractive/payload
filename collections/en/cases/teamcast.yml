    body: |
      Working within an agile process, we developed the app concept, UX and UI designs within weeks and built an MVP. Since then the product is being used on a daily basis at several companies. User feedback, which we constantly collect, is used to consistently optimise the web app.

    title: Staff planning in real time
    body: |
      With the help of Teamcast, employees and construction sites can be created and assigned to each other with just a few clicks. This reduces the effort for weekly planning many times over. At the same time, team management and employees have access to real-time data at any time and can react quickly and flexibly in case of breakdowns or changes in plans.
