      As a user interface designer you are responsible for the conception and design of digital projects. You are passionate about consistent, functional and visually appealing user interfaces that focus on users and their needs. Whether landing page, microsite, corporate website, digital portal or app â€“ you accompany a project from the initial idea to the successful launch and are also involved in the consistent refinement of existing measures.
