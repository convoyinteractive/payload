      In all that we do, we focus on the users, their needs, expectations and habits first. As outsiders we are unbiased and see things from a different perspective. This leads to applications that people believe in and that are actually used.

        term: User research
        body: |
          With the help of user journey maps we identify possible touchpoints as well as critical phases along the customer journey. We analyse when and how your products or services are applied and what is important to users in the process. Our aim is to understand needs and usage contexts and to bring them in line with your company’s requirements.

        term: Usability testing
        body: |
          We develop user interfaces taking into account the user, context and end device. Before pursuing an approach to solving the problem, we test usability and user experience extensively using prototypes. In addition, we support you in improving the usability of existing measures and applications in place.

        term: Information architecture
        body: |
          A logical page layout and an understandable structure are the basis for intuitive usability and a compelling user experience. User flows and wireframes help us to visualise and set up site maps and information architecture. This enables us to structure even complex information in such a way that users quickly find the contents that they are looking for.

        term: Conversion optimisation
        body: |
          Even the most user-friendly marketing measure is only successful if it contributes to meeting your business objectives and delivers measurable results. For us to optimally plan digital services or offers, we need to understand the target group and usage context. This allows us to design content that is not only optimised for search engines but also tailored to your needs. In addition, clear objectives help with tracking and evaluating leads and conversions.
